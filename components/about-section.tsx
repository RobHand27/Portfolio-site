                  In my full-stack development roles, I love to build and deploy cool and impactful projects. I've built UI components in frameworks like React and Vue, and backend components in frameworks like Node, Flask, Express, and SpringBoot.
                  I've developed both Restful APIs and FastAPI endpoints, and have experience with databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, Neo4j, and MongoDB. Most of my ML work involves libraries including, Pytorch, Tensorflow, Scikit Learn, Pandas, and Numpy. Most of my work is public on my{' '}

                My most recent role was as a Software Engineer Intern at Synchrony Financial, where I worked on internal facing full-stack applications using ReactJS and Java Springboot.
                During the school term, I also worked as an Undergraduate Researcher with Forward Data Lab under Professor Kevin Chang. Here I conducted research on RAG methodologies, analyzing model strengths and limitations
                through comparison of LLM reasoning, topic grounding, and data extraction. This work included my backend code contributions to an academic paper discovery tool being developed in Forward Data Lab.
                Im also involved in UIUC's Disruption Lab, where I have had the privledge to develop full-stack applications and ML tools for clients such as the Data Science Research Institute and PowerBox Technologies with teams of other top engineers on campus.
